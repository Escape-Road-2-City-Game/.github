### 💡 **Top 7 Tips & Tricks to Master Escape Road 2**

1. **Stay Focused Early On**
   Don’t let the slow start fool you. Use the early seconds to settle in and prepare for sharp turns.

2. **Master the Corners**

   The more you play, the better your muscle memory and reflexes become. Aim for gradual improvement.
